# Nutrition Calculator

A comprehensive nutrition calculator that provides personalized daily calorie needs and macronutrient recommendations based on your body metrics and activity level.

## Features

### Body Metrics Calculations

1. **BMI (Body Mass Index)**
   - Formula: `Weight (kg) / (Height (m) Ã— Height (m))`
   - Categories:
     - Underweight: < 18.5
     - Normal: 18.5 - 24.9
     - Overweight: 25 - 29.9
     - Obese: â‰¥ 30

2. **BMR (Basal Metabolic Rate)**
   - Men: `10 Ã— weight (kg) + 6.25 Ã— height (cm) - 5 Ã— age (years) + 5`
   - Women: `10 Ã— weight (kg) + 6.25 Ã— height (cm) - 5 Ã— age (years) - 161`
   - This is your calorie burn at complete rest

3. **Daily Calorie Needs**
   - Based on BMR multiplied by activity level:
     - **Sedentary** (little or no exercise): BMR Ã— 1.2
     - **Lightly Active** (1-3 times/week): BMR Ã— 1.375
     - **Somewhat Active** (4-5 times/week): BMR Ã— 1.465
     - **Moderately Active** (daily exercise or intense 3-4Ã—/week): BMR Ã— 1.55
     - **Very Active** (intense 6-7 times/week): BMR Ã— 1.725
     - **Extremely Active** (very intense daily or physical job): BMR Ã— 1.9

### Macronutrient Recommendations

1. **Carbohydrates**
   - 40-45% of daily calories
   - Calculation: `(Daily Calories Ã— 0.40-0.45) / 4`
   - Provides 4 calories per gram

2. **Protein**
   - 1.8-2.2g per kg body weight
   - Calculation: `Weight (kg) Ã— 1.8-2.2`
   - Essential for muscle maintenance and growth

3. **Fats**
   - 20-25% of daily calories
   - Calculation: `(Daily Calories Ã— 0.20-0.25) / 9`
   - Provides 9 calories per gram

4. **Water Intake**
   - Formula: `Weight (kg) Ã— 30 / 1000 = Liters`
   - Example: 67kg person needs ~2.0L daily
