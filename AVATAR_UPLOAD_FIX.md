# Avatar Upload Fix Summary

## Problem
Users were experiencing `ERR_INTERNET_DISCONNECTED` errors when trying to upload profile pictures. This was caused by:
1. Browser being in offline mode
2. Supabase storage buckets not being configured
3. No network status feedback in the app

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Added Network Status Detection
- Created `useNetworkStatus` hook using `@react-native-community/netinfo`
- Monitors real-time connection status
- Detects both WiFi and cellular connectivity

### 2. Added Offline Banner
- Red banner appears at top of screen when offline
- Shows WiFi-off icon and clear message
- Automatically disappears when connection restored

### 3. Improved Avatar Upload Function
- **Network check before upload** - Blocks upload attempts when offline
- **Simplified to local storage** - No cloud upload until buckets configured
- **Better error messages** - Distinguishes between network and other errors
- **Fixed filename generation** - Prevents corrupted extensions

### 4. User-Friendly Messages
Shows appropriate alerts for different scenarios:
- ✅ "No Internet Connection" - When offline
- ✅ "Network Error" - When connection lost during upload
- ✅ "Profile picture updated!" - With note about local storage

## Files Changed

### New Files
- `src/hooks/useNetworkStatus.ts` - Network status hook
- `TROUBLESHOOTING_AVATAR_UPLOAD.md` - Troubleshooting guide
- `SUPABASE_STORAGE_SETUP.md` - Storage bucket setup guide

### Modified Files
- `src/screens/ProfileScreen.tsx`:
  - Added offline banner
  - Added network status check
  - Simplified upload to local storage
  - Better error handling
  - Fixed filename extension bug
  
- `src/hooks/index.ts`:
  - Exported `useNetworkStatus` hook

## How It Works Now

### Current Behavior (Local Storage)
1. User taps avatar → Select image
2. App checks internet connection
3. If offline → Show error, block upload
4. If online → Save image URI to database
5. Avatar displays immediately
6. Image persists in profile

**Advantages:**
- ✅ Works without Supabase storage setup
- ✅ Fast and reliable
- ✅ Good for development
- ❌ Won't sync across devices (local URI only)

### Future Behavior (Cloud Storage - When Enabled)
Uncomment the cloud upload code in `ProfileScreen.tsx` after setting up storage buckets:
1. User selects image
2. Convert to blob
3. Upload to Supabase Storage
4. Get public URL
5. Save public URL to database
6. Avatar syncs across all devices

## Testing

### Test Offline Detection
1. Open app in browser
2. Open DevTools (F12) → Network tab
3. Check "Offline" checkbox
4. Red banner should appear at top of screen
5. Try to upload avatar → Get "No Internet Connection" alert
6. Uncheck "Offline" → Banner disappears

### Test Avatar Upload
1. Ensure you're online (no red banner)
2. Go to Profile screen
3. Tap avatar
4. Select an image
5. Should see: "Profile picture updated! Note: Image is stored locally..."
6. Avatar should display immediately
7. Reload app → Avatar persists

## Next Steps

### For Development
Current setup is fine! Avatar upload works with local storage.

### For Production
Follow the `SUPABASE_STORAGE_SETUP.md` guide to:
1. Create `profile-images` bucket in Supabase
2. Set up security policies
3. Uncomment cloud upload code in ProfileScreen.tsx
4. Test end-to-end upload

## Troubleshooting

If users still see network errors:

### Browser Issues
- Check DevTools Network tab → "Offline" should be unchecked
- Clear cache and hard reload (Ctrl+Shift+R)
- Try incognito mode
- Disable extensions that might block requests

### App Issues
- Restart Expo dev server
- Clear Expo cache: `npm start -- --clear`
- Check `.env` file has correct Supabase credentials

### Mobile Issues
- Check device has internet access
- Try switching WiFi/cellular
- Restart app
- Check system network permissions

## Technical Details

### Network Status Hook
```typescript
const { isOnline, isConnected, isInternetReachable } = useNetworkStatus();
```
- `isOnline`: Combined boolean (connected + internet reachable)
- `isConnected`: Device has network connection
- `isInternetReachable`: Can reach the internet

### Error Detection
The app now distinguishes between:
1. **Network errors** → "Check your internet connection"
2. **Storage errors** → "Storage bucket may not be configured"
3. **Permission errors** → "Grant permission to access photos"
4. **General errors** → Specific error message
